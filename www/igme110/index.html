<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Tina DiLorenzo. I am a first year game design student.<br>I really,
enjoy pressing flowers, spending time with friends, and fashion.<br>My
favorite games are Persona 4, Minecraft, Limbo, and Don't Starve.<br>Persona 4 is
my all time favorite game, but today I will be talking about<br>Minecraft instead.<br>
<br><p>


<p> Minecraft is my most played game because of its fun gameplay. I run a<br>server called
"Beefboy76" and within it there is a town called Arby's.<br>There are 11 people on the
server. We are a survival only server, but I will<br>occassionaly provide spawned in
materials if requested. As shown with the<br>photo, there are a lot of public works
projects created by every member of <br>the server. We even have a western sector.</p>
