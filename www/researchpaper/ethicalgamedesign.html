<h2>Ethical game design </h2>
<p class="smaller"> Some gameplay mechanics can be used to encourage players to spend more money or more money on the game<br>
  they are playing. Those with gaming addictions are more likely to fall into these schemes. Love Live! School Idol<Br>
  festival, for example, rewards players for logging in everyday even if they are not playing the app. Repeated log in<br>
  reinfoces players to feel as though they have to check the app, which could lead to addiction.<br>
  <br> <br>
  While World of Warcraft has its flaws and and does have some unethical mechanics, it does have a rest feature. The rest<br>
  feature is a positive method that encourages players to take breaks by making them gain exp at a faster rate if they<br>
  take a break for some time. Little features like this are a step in the right direction for discouraging game addiction.
