<h3> GAMING ADDICTION?</h3>

<p>Gaming addiction was only recently classified as a disorder in May of <br>
  2019 by the World Health Organization. This recent classification states <br>
  that frequent gaming becomes an addiction when it is, “characterized by<br>
  impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other<br>
  activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests<br>
  and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the<br>
  occurrence of negative consequences.” (World Health Organization 2018). <br>
