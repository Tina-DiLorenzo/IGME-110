<h2>What is a</h2>
<h3> GAMING ADDICTION?</h3>

<p>Gaming addiction was only recently classified as a disorder in May of <br>
  2019 by the World Health Organization. This recent classification states <br>
  that frequent gaming becomes an addiction when it is, “characterized by<br>
  impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other<br>
  activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests<br>
  and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the<br>
  occurrence of negative consequences.” (World Health Organization 2018). <br>
<br><p>



<p>While games are created to entertain, too much of a good thing can become <br>
  a problem. Too much gaming, for example, may lead to gaming addiction. Rather<br>
  than for entertainment, players may become unable to tear themselves away from<br>
  their computer and may even spend a gratuitous amount of money on in-game <br>
  purchases similar to gambling addiction. Game designers incorporate addictive <br>
  tactics as a way to keep players invested and to earn more money at the expense <br>
  of their player base. Game designers should recognize their obligation to keep<br>
  players safe due to the negative consequences of game addictions, the ability to<br>
  encourage breaks, and backlash from players.</p><br><br>
